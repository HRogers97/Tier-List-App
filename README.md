This is an app that allows users to create their own tier lists as well as view other users tier lists. This project uses an SQLlite database for storing data. It contains two default tier lists, and any new lists created will be added to the database. 

## Searching tier lists
This is the first page seen when opening the app, it will display the tier lists found on the database. Users can select a specific category to only view tier lists tagged with that category.

## Creating a tier list

Creating a tier list is done by selecting an image from the user's gallery and choosing which tier to add it into. Users can create any number of tiers they want and also name them. Each tier has a name on the side (usually just a letter) as well as a colour associated with the tier. The higher the tier is on the list, the better or more valuable it is meant to be.

## Discussion

When viewing a tier list users can leave comments. Comments may be edited or deleted while still viewing the tier list, however once the user exists the viewing page for the tier list they lose those abilities. Clicking on any item in the tier list will open up the suggestions page.

## Reviews

Tapping an item in a tier list will open up the review page where a user may suggest a change to the tier list. For example, they may suggest this item should be a lower tier and they can leave a comment explaining why.
